# Proposal for a new SMEFT basis

## How to use GitHub markdown for writing TeX
Here we can collect the operators that we do/don't want to have in the basis.
TeX can be used as `$O_{lequ}$`: $O_{lequ}$ for inline TeX and
```

$$
O_{lequ}
$$

```

$$
O_{lequ}
$$

for an equation block. For more details see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/writing-mathematical-expressions).

For general markdown commands, there is a [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) with a quick overview.
